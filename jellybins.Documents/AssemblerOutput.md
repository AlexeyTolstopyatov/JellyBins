# Unix Object Format
### a.out Format: A Detailed Overview
The **a.out** format is a simple and compact executable file format used in early Unix systems. It was designed to be straightforward and easy to parse, making it suitable for the limited resources of early computers. Despite its simplicity, the a.out format laid the groundwork for more complex formats like ELF (Executable and Linkable Format).

### 1. **Structure of an a.out File**
An a.out file consists of several key sections, each serving a specific purpose. The main parts of an a.out file are:

#### 1.1 **Exec Header**
- The **exec header** is the first part of the a.out file and contains essential information about the executable.
- It typically includes the following fields:
  - **Magic Number**: Identifies the file as an a.out executable (e.g., 0x0107 for ZMAGIC).
  - **Text Size**: The size of the text (code) section.
  - **Data Size**: The size of the initialized data section.
  - **BSS Size**: The size of the uninitialized data section (Block Started by Symbol).
  - **Symbol Table Size**: The size of the symbol table.
  - **Entry Point**: The memory address where execution begins.
  - **Text Relocation Size**: The size of the text relocation table.
  - **Data Relocation Size**: The size of the data relocation table.

#### 1.2 **Text Section**
- The **text section** contains the executable code of the program.
- It is loaded into memory at a fixed address specified in the exec header.

#### 1.3 **Data Section**
- The **data section** contains initialized global and static variables.
- It is loaded into memory immediately after the text section.

#### 1.4 **BSS Section**
- The **BSS section** contains uninitialized global and static variables.
- It is not stored in the file but is allocated in memory at runtime.

#### 1.5 **Symbol Table**
- The **symbol table** contains information about the symbols (functions and variables) defined and used in the program.
- Each symbol table entry typically includes:
  - **Name**: The name of the symbol.
  - **Type**: The type of the symbol (e.g., function, variable).
  - **Value**: The address or value of the symbol.
  - **Section**: The section to which the symbol belongs (e.g., text, data).

#### 1.6 **Relocation Tables**
- The **text relocation table** and **data relocation table** contain information for relocating the text and data sections.
- Each relocation entry typically includes:
  - **Address**: The address to be relocated.
  - **Symbol Index**: The index of the symbol in the symbol table.
  - **Type**: The type of relocation (e.g., absolute, relative).

### 2. **Key Features of the a.out Format**
- **Simplicity**: The a.out format is straightforward and easy to parse, making it suitable for early Unix systems with limited resources.
- **Fixed Memory Layout**: The text and data sections are loaded at fixed memory addresses, which simplifies loading but limits flexibility.
- **Symbol Table**: The symbol table provides detailed information about the symbols in the program, which is useful for debugging and linking.
- **Relocation Tables**: The relocation tables allow the executable to be loaded at different memory addresses, although this feature is limited compared to more modern formats.

### 3. **Loading and Execution**
When an a.out file is executed, the Unix loader performs the following steps:
1. **Read the Exec Header**: Verify the magic number and parse the header information.
2. **Load the Text Section**: Allocate memory and load the text section at the specified address.
3. **Load the Data Section**: Allocate memory and load the data section immediately after the text section.
4. **Allocate the BSS Section**: Allocate memory for the BSS section and initialize it to zero.
5. **Apply Relocations**: Adjust addresses in the text and data sections using the relocation tables.
6. **Execute the Entry Point**: Transfer control to the entry point specified in the exec header.

### 4. **Common Uses of the a.out Format**
- **Early Unix Systems**: The a.out format was used in early versions of Unix, including Version 7 Unix and BSD.
- **Legacy Systems**: Some legacy Unix-like systems and embedded systems still use the a.out format.
